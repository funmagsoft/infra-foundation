## Getting Started

1. Review infra documentation [README.md](https://github.com/funmagsoft/infra-documentation/blob/main/README.md)

## Prerequisites: Setup Phase 0 Infrastructure

Before running Terraform, you must set up the foundational infrastructure using the setup scripts in the `scripts/` directory. These scripts create the necessary Azure resources that Terraform requires.

### Required Steps (in order):

1. **Configure environment variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:
     - `TENANT_ID` - Your Azure AD Tenant ID
     - `SUBSCRIPTION_ID` - Your Azure Subscription ID
     - `LOCATION` - Azure region (e.g., "polandcentral")
   - Project constants are defined in `scripts/globals.sh` (ORGANIZATION, ORGANIZATION_FOR_SA, PROJECT)

2. **Run setup scripts** (in order):
   - `scripts/setup-rg.sh` - Creates Resource Groups for all environments (dev, test, stage, prod)
   - `scripts/setup-state-storage.sh` - Creates Terraform State Storage Accounts with containers, versioning, and soft delete enabled
   - `scripts/setup-access.sh` - Creates Service Principals for GitHub Actions, Federated Identity Credentials (FIC), and RBAC role assignments
   - `scripts/setup-access-user.sh` - Grants Storage Blob Data Contributor role to current user for viewing state files in Azure Portal
   - `scripts/setup-access-sp.sh` - Grants Storage Blob Data Contributor role to Service Principals for accessing state files

   **Or use the convenience script:**
   - `scripts/setup-all.sh` - Runs all setup scripts in the correct order automatically

3. **Verify setup**:
   - `scripts/verify-all.sh` - Verifies all resources were created correctly

4. **Cleanup (if needed)**:
   - `scripts/cleanup-all.sh` - Removes all resources created by setup scripts (RBAC, FIC, Service Principals, Storage Accounts, Resource Groups)
   - Supports `--dry-run` option to preview what will be deleted

### Setup Scripts Description:

- **`setup-rg.sh`** - Creates 4 Resource Groups (one per environment) with proper tags for Terraform management. These Resource Groups serve as containers for all infrastructure resources that Terraform will create and manage. Each Resource Group is scoped to a specific environment (dev, test, stage, prod) and is required before creating any resources within it.

- **`setup-state-storage.sh`** - Creates Storage Accounts for Terraform state with blob versioning, soft delete, and secure access settings. These Storage Accounts store Terraform's state files (`.tfstate`) which track the current state of your infrastructure. The state files are critical - they allow Terraform to know what resources exist, their configuration, and dependencies. Without proper state storage, Terraform cannot manage your infrastructure correctly. Each environment has its own Storage Account with a dedicated `tfstate` container.

- **`setup-access.sh`** - Creates Service Principals for GitHub Actions OIDC authentication, configures Federated Identity Credentials (FIC) for all repos, and assigns RBAC roles.
  
  **Service Principals:**
  - Creates 4 Service Principals (one per environment: dev, test, stage, prod)
  - Azure AD identities that allow automated access to Azure resources
  - GitHub Actions workflows use these to authenticate to Azure
  - Named: `sp-gha-${PROJECT}-infra-${ENV}`
  
  **Federated Identity Credentials (FIC):**
  - Enables passwordless authentication using OpenID Connect (OIDC)
  - GitHub Actions can request Azure access tokens without storing secrets
  - Creates 12 FIC total (3 repos × 4 environments):
    - `infra-foundation` repository for each environment
    - `infra-platform` repository for each environment
    - `infra-workload-identity` repository for each environment
  - Each FIC is scoped to a specific GitHub repository and environment
  
  **RBAC Role Assignments:**
  - **Contributor** (on Resource Group and Subscription):
    - Allows Terraform to create/modify/delete resources
    - Required for all Terraform operations on infrastructure
  - **User Access Administrator** (on Resource Group):
    - Allows Terraform to assign roles to Managed Identities it creates
    - Required when Terraform creates resources that need role assignments (e.g., Managed Identities)
  - **Storage Blob Data Contributor** (on Storage Account):
    - Allows reading/writing Terraform state files
    - Required for Terraform to access and update state in remote backend
  
  These roles are essential for Terraform to manage infrastructure and state files in GitHub Actions workflows.

- **`setup-access-user.sh`** - Grants the current user Storage Blob Data Contributor role on all state storage accounts for Azure Portal access. This allows you (the subscription owner) to view and browse Terraform state files directly in Azure Portal, which is useful for debugging, auditing, and understanding the current infrastructure state. Without this role, you cannot access the state files through the portal, even though you own the subscription.

- **`setup-access-sp.sh`** - Grants Service Principals Storage Blob Data Contributor role on their respective state storage accounts for Terraform state access. This is a critical role assignment - it allows the Service Principals created by `setup-access.sh` to read and write Terraform state files stored in the Storage Accounts. When Terraform runs in GitHub Actions, it needs to authenticate as the Service Principal and access the state files to track infrastructure changes. Without this role, Terraform cannot read or update the state, causing deployments to fail.

All setup scripts support `--dry-run` option to preview changes without executing them.

### Cleanup Scripts:

- **`cleanup-all.sh`** - Comprehensive cleanup script that removes all resources created by setup scripts in the correct order:
  1. RBAC role assignments (to avoid dependency issues)
  2. Federated Identity Credentials (FIC)
  3. Service Principals
  4. Storage Accounts (and all containers within them)
  5. Resource Groups
  6. `service-principals.env` file (if exists)
  
  This script is useful for:
  - Resetting the infrastructure setup
  - Cleaning up test environments
  - Removing resources before recreating them
  
  **Warning**: This script will delete all Phase 0 infrastructure. Use with caution and always test with `--dry-run` first.

## Running Terraform

After completing the Phase 0 setup, you can proceed with Terraform deployment:

### 1. Navigate to the environment directory

```bash
cd terraform/environments/dev  # or test, stage, prod
```

### 2. Configure Terraform variables

Copy the example variables file and customize it:

```bash
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
```

Edit `terraform.tfvars` and configure:
- `resource_group_name` - Resource Group name (e.g., "rg-ecare-dev")
- Network CIDR blocks for VNet and subnets
- `mgmt_subnet_allowed_ssh_ips` - List of IP addresses/CIDR blocks allowed for SSH access to management subnet (e.g., `["91.150.222.105"]`)
- VPN Gateway settings (if needed)

**Important**: `terraform.tfvars` is in `.gitignore` and should not be committed. Use `terraform.tfvars.example` as a template.

### 3. Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

This will:
- Download required providers (azurerm)
- Configure the backend to use the Storage Account created in Phase 0
- Set up authentication using Azure AD (no credentials needed if logged in via `az login`)

### 4. Review the execution plan

```bash
terraform plan
```

This shows what resources Terraform will create, modify, or destroy without making any changes.

### 5. Apply the configuration

```bash
terraform apply
```

This will create the infrastructure resources defined in your Terraform configuration. Terraform will prompt for confirmation before making changes.

### 6. Verify deployment

After successful deployment, you can verify the resources:
- Use `scripts/verify-all.sh` to verify all Phase 0 resources
- Check Azure Portal for created resources
- Review Terraform outputs: `terraform output`

## Network Security Configuration

### Management Subnet SSH Access

The management subnet (mgmt) is used for bastion hosts and other management VMs. By default, SSH access from the internet is blocked by NSG rules. To allow SSH access from specific IP addresses:

1. Configure `mgmt_subnet_allowed_ssh_ips` in `terraform.tfvars`:
   ```hcl
   mgmt_subnet_allowed_ssh_ips = ["91.150.222.105", "203.0.113.0/24"]
   ```

2. Apply the Terraform configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

This will create an NSG rule `AllowSSHInbound` (priority 200) that allows SSH (port 22) from the specified IP addresses/CIDR blocks. If the list is empty, SSH from the internet remains blocked.

**Security Note**: Always restrict SSH access to trusted IP addresses. For production environments, consider using VPN Gateway or Azure Bastion service instead of direct SSH access.

### Important Notes:

- **State Management**: Terraform state is stored remotely in the Storage Account configured in `backend.tf`. Never commit `.tfstate` files to git.
- **Environment Isolation**: Each environment (dev, test, stage, prod) has separate state files and Resource Groups, ensuring complete isolation.
- **Authentication**: Terraform uses Azure AD authentication (configured via `use_azuread_auth = true` in `backend.tf`). Ensure you're logged in via `az login` or that GitHub Actions has proper OIDC configuration.
- **Backend Configuration**: The backend configuration in `backend.tf` points to the Storage Accounts created by `setup-state-storage.sh`. If you change the Storage Account names, update `backend.tf` accordingly.
